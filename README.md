Shadowfist UNlimited is an imagined reboot of Shadowfist. It contains the original 3 sets by Daedalus, using the current rulebook. Both contain some changes.

## Notes
* Faction identity is important. Out of faction abilities exist, but they tend to have an extra cost, a drawback, or are specifically cross-faction cards.
* * Architects specialize in abominations (and tokens), soldiers, Ambush, direct removal, guns and vehicles.
* * Ascended specialize in control and manipulation, Pledged, Lodge, power theft, Stealth, and a bit more available power generation. Their access to Chi from modern is retained.
* * Dragons specialize in a wide variety of characters, limited access to all 3 talents, recursion, unturn, and scrappy comeback cards.
* * Hand specialize in Superleap, healing, defense, cancel.
* * Lotus specialize in small character recursion, weenie hordes, magic zaps, utility magic, temporary control, damage and growth over time, and regenerate.
* * Jammers specialize in smoking sites, and they get a new card to make this a winning tactic.
* * Monarchs...don't specialize in anything and probably need a lot more thought.

* Tokens are introduced to the original set, but a very limited, specific set of tokens. There are 3 kinds of Abomination tokens, Mook tokens, and Really Big Gun tokens only, with appropriate token generators. This was done because tokens introduced by Inner Kingdom Games were somewhat bland and the same across all factions. Instead, Architects have a focus on tokens to represent the Overwhelming Force of their abomination army, Dragons get Really Big Gun generators, and Hoods get mook generators. Finally mooks can actually be what they're meant to be: An unlimited supply of replaceable goons.

* Redirection now happens only "When damage is inflicted". This introduces a single closed scene, where damage is on the stack, but has not yet been received. All cards that redirect are rewritten to only redirect at that point. There are no signposts; when the scene resolves, inflicted damage lands where it's supposed to go.

* A few cards were brought in from Z-Man era to make Lotus to try and ensure they have a faction identity they didn't really get in the Daedalus era.

* EXPERIMENTAL: 2 and 3 cost foundations now provide extra resources to to make them worthwhile.

* Pocket Demon and Violet Meditation are removed. These cards were must plays in any deck, and all decks had access to them. Instead, a new focus has been made on more faction appropriate APG, and APG from sites.

* A big attempt has been made to ensure 1 and 2 cost non-foundations are viable. This is a difficult space to design for.

* The Operation Killdeer characters are all reimagined as much more interesting, powerful characters. Most Big Stick characters are more interesting.

* All faction hosers have been rewritten; some of them allow you to choose a faction or designator when played, others have been reinvisioned as something else entirely. Cry of the Forgotten Ancestor is one of the few that remain.
